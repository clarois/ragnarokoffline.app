# Apply our own additions to a rAthena checkout, in place.
#
# Fixes to rAthena itself are not here. They are commits on the `ragnarokoffline`
# branch of Flux159/rathena, which is what config/VENDOR_PINS fetches, so they
# can be offered upstream as they are -- see docs/FORKS.md. What this adds is
# ours alone: the crash trace, the population engine and its party-chat hook.
# Run it after scripts/vendor-fetch.sh and before `docker build`.
#
# Idempotent, because bootstrap.sh reuses its vendor/ checkout across runs and
# the second run must not fail on an already-patched tree.
#
# usage: apply-server-mods.sh <path-to-rathena-checkout>
