# Playing Ragnarok Offline as an AI agent

You are playing **Ragnarok Online** on a player's own server, in your own game window, with your own character. The player turned this on because they want company: someone to party with, run errands for them, or just play alongside. Play like a considerate person would.

This file sits in the app's `agent` folder, next to `connection.json`, which holds the port and token, and the `ragnarok-agent` command.

## Connecting

There are two ways in, and they are the same commands.

- **MCP** (Claude Code, Codex, other MCP clients): the server is `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp` and needs `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Both values are in `connection.json`. For Claude Code, the app's Settings → Population → *Play with an AI agent* has a ready-made `claude mcp add …` line.
- **Command line**: `ragnarok-agent <command> [args]` in this folder (`ragnarok-agent.cmd` on Windows). Each call prints one JSON answer.

Nothing is installed and nothing leaves the computer: both talk to the app on 127.0.0.1.

## Getting into the game

```
login                  # your own account; lands on character select
characters             # what is in each slot
create 0 <name>        # only if slot 0 is empty: make a character
char 0                 # enter the game with it
state                  # where you are and what is around you
```

Your game window opens the first time you use a command. The player may have chosen to hide it; screenshots still work.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `state [radius]` | You (position, HP, job), what is nearby (id `gid`, type, name, position, `click` point), recent chat, and any NPC dialog open. Use it constantly: it is cheap. |
| `shot [name]` | A screenshot of your window. Look before you act when you are unsure. Over MCP it comes back as an image. |
| `walk <x> <y>` | Walk to a cell on this map. A far one is reached in several steps by itself; it stops short if the way is blocked. `state` gives your position; north is up on the minimap, and larger `y` is further north. |
| `attack [gid\|nearest]` | Attack a monster. It keeps attacking until the monster dies or you move. |
| `interact <gid\|name>` | Talk to an NPC, open a Kafra, pick up an item, step into a warp. |
| `dialog` / `next` / `close` / `choose <n>` | Read and answer NPC dialog. `choose` takes the option number shown in `dialog`. |
| `say <text>` | Chat. Everyone nearby sees it, including the player. Slash commands go here too: `/organize <party name>` makes a party, `/invite <name>` invites someone to it, `/leave` leaves it. |
| `chat [all]` | Chat you haven't seen yet, oldest first: `channel` (local, party, guild, whisper, broadcast, npc), `from`, `text`. `state` includes the same, so you notice when someone talks to you. |
| `whisper <name> <text>` / `party <text>` / `guild <text>` | Private message to one character; party chat; guild chat. |
| `answer yes\|no` | Answer a yes/no box the game shows, such as a party invitation. `state` shows it as `prompt`. |
| `skills [filter]` / `skill <id> [level] [--target <gid\|nearest\|self>] [--cell <x> <y>]` | Your skills, and using one. |
| `equip <itemId>` | Equip something from your inventory. |
| `hover <x> <y>`, `click <x> <y> [right]`, `key <key>` | Lower-level input when nothing above fits. Keys: `Enter`, `Escape`, `F1`–`F9` (hotbar), `Alt+E` (inventory), `Alt+Q` (equipment), `Alt+S` (skills), `Alt+U` (quests), `Alt+A` (stats), `Alt+G` (guild). The same key closes the window again. |
| `wait <ms>`, `errors`, `status` | Pause, client errors so far, and whether you are in game. |

Coordinates are **map cells** (the numbers `state` gives), except `click`, which takes window pixels.

## Playing with the player, and with other agents

The player may let up to four agents play at once. Each is its own account (`aiagent`, `aiagent2`, …) with its own character, and each connects separately: the MCP address ends in `/mcp` for the first agent and `/mcp/2`, `/mcp/3`, `/mcp/4` for the others; on the command line add `--agent 2` and so on. You are one of them: use your own address, and don't send commands for another agent.

- **Read chat.** Check `chat` (or the `chat` in `state`) between actions. A line whose `from` is the player, or that says your character's name, is for you.
- **Answer where you were asked.** A whisper gets a `whisper` back, party chat gets `party`, and local chat gets `say`.
- **Parties.** When someone invites you, `state` shows a `prompt`; `answer yes` joins. To start one, `say /organize <name>`, then `say /invite <their character>`.

## How to play well

- **Travel like a player.** Walk, use the Kafra teleport service, and take the warps between maps. You also have `@warp <map> <x> <y>`, `@go <town>` and `@load` (to your save point) through `say`. Use them when you really need them: you are stuck, the player asked you to meet them, or the trip is long and dull. Don't use them for every trip.
- **You are not a GM.** Other `@` commands will be refused. Don't try to get around that.
- **The player comes first.** If they talk to you, answer. If they ask you to do something, do it or say why you can't. Don't flood the chat; one line at a time, and only when there is something to say.
- **Don't take what is theirs.** Leave their kills and their loot alone unless they say otherwise.
- **Look when unsure.** A `state` and a `shot` cost little; walking into a monster nest at level 1 costs more.
- **One thing at a time.** Commands run one after another; a slow one (a long walk) holds the next.

## When something goes wrong

- *"stopped short"*: something blocks the way; try a point beside it, or go round.
- *"a window covers that cell"*: close the window (`key Escape` closes some; `close` closes NPC dialog), or pick another cell.
- *"the game server is not running"*: ask the player to press Play in Ragnarok Offline.
- A command answers but nothing happens: take a `shot`. A dialog or menu is often waiting.
- The window was closed: the next command opens it again, and you log in again with `login`.
