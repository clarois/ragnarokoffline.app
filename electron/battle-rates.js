// bosses, and MVPs -- and reads a separate key per item category in each.
// Only part of two families were ever written: bosses got common, equipment
// and card but not healing or usable, and MVPs got nothing at all. A player
// who raised the sliders saw them work on ordinary monsters and not on the
// monsters they most wanted them for, which is what `@rates` reported.
//
// Generated from one table so a family cannot go half-covered again, and kept
// in its own module because main.js exports nothing and so nothing here could
// be tested -- which is the reason this went out wrong.

// The five categories rAthena scales, and which slider each follows. Healing
// and usable ride the item slider alongside common: the UI offers three
// numbers, not five, and splitting them here would invent a setting.

// hand-edited settings.json from asking for a map the server cannot walk.
