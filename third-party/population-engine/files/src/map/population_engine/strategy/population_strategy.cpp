// Unity build: population_engine_factory.cpp includes this file LAST, after
// population_engine_combat.cpp and the expanded-condition parser. It uses three of the
// combat file's own checks (pop_skill_weapon_ok, pop_skill_state_ok,
// population_shell_resolve_sc_name) so a rule refuses a cast exactly where the skill
// rotation would; they are internal to that file and only visible here because of
// that order.
//
// Everything runs on the map server's main thread. No randomness: the same situation
// gives the same decision, so a rule set can be reasoned about and traced.
