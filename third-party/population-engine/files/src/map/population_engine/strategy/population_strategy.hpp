// RAGNAROKMAC (companion strategies): per-monster, per-job rules for recruited
// companions, read from db/population_strategy.yml and every mod's copy of it.
//
// The whole feature lives in this file and population_strategy.cpp. The engine
// reaches it through the functions below, each called from one marked line:
//
//   population_engine.cpp   load, reload and final; party chat; the companion's target;
//                           owner-follow and the idle formation step (holding position)
//   population_engine_combat.cpp   the companion's turn; the skill rotation's filter
//
// With no rules loaded (the shipped table is empty) every hook returns at once and
// the engine behaves exactly as it did without it. Regular shells are touched only
// by plans a mod marks For: shells or For: all; the rest is for companions.
