// Guard: every component reference the patch script injects into an engine file
// must have a matching import in that same file.
//
// The bug this exists for: patch-client.sh inserted `CompanionPanel.prepare()`
// into MapEngine.js without adding the matching import. A bundler does not resolve
// bare identifiers, so it compiled cleanly and threw "CompanionPanel is not
// defined" the moment MapEngine.init ran. Because that throw is inside init(),
// everything after it was skipped - including ChatBox.onRequestTalk's assignment
// and the other UI engines' setup - so one missing import looked like three
// unrelated bugs and a half-built interface.
//
// Two traps this file has already fallen into, both worth remembering:
//   1. Matching the bare import string passes on the buggy commit, because the
//      BasicInfoCommon edit carries the same text. Assertions must be anchored to
//      the MapEngine edit specifically.
//   2. The script builds the inserted import by concatenation, so asserting a
//      literal two-line block fails on a correct patch. Assert on the pieces.
