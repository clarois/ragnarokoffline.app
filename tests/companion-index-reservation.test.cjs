// Guards for the companion/ambient index reservation.
//
// WHY this exists: a companion with every skill disabled kept casting, and three separate
// correct fixes (per-tick re-seed, buff-guard, sphere-chain gate) all looked ineffective.
// The cause was not any of them - it was that the player's selection was being attached to
// the WRONG SHELL.
//
// `population_engine_allocate_index()` handed out indices from a counter that resets to 1 on
// every engine start (`store(1)` at two sites) and never consulted `cp_companion_persistence`,
// while a recruited companion keeps its permanent index forever. So an ambient town shell
// could be issued an index a companion already owned; both then carried the same
// `char_id = CHAR_ID_BASE + index`. The selector resolves "the live shell" BY INDEX while the
// UI resolves BY NAME, so the panel correctly showed "0 of 19 selected" for a shell that was
// not the one casting.
//
// Measured evidence: five distinct names logged at idx=307 in one session, exactly one with
// `override=1`, and the allocator's wrap warning never fired - so the counter reset, not pool
// exhaustion.
//
// A compile test cannot catch this class: stripping the reservation guard still compiles with
// zero errors (verified). So these assertions pin the CODE RELATIONSHIPS that make the two
// index spaces disjoint, and one pins the runtime diagnostic that would otherwise be the only
// detector.
