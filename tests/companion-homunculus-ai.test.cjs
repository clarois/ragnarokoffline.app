// through the calls rAthena's own homunculus AI commands use, stay leashed to the companion, and
// run inside the shell's existing combat tick rather than a timer of its own.
//
// Why this file matters: a homunculus has no AI server-side at all - its brain is client-side Lua
// (docs/CUSTOM_HOMUNCULUS_AI.md), which a population shell can never run. Nothing in rAthena makes
// a BL_HOM act on its own, so these relationships are the entire mechanism, and a compile check
// cannot see any of them.
