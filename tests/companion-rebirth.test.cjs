// windows-latest checks text files out with CRLF; normalise on read so assertions about file
// content do not depend on the checkout's newline convention.
// Guards for companion rebirth: the player's explicit choice, never automatic.
//
// WHY this exists, in one line: advancement used to take the rebirth on its own, and the gate on
// those rows asked for job 70 while a 2nd class stops at job 50 - so no companion could ever get
// past its 2nd job, and fixing the gate alone would have started stripping gear without asking.
//
// The three things pinned here are the ones that would silently regress:
//   1. the gate on the REBIRTH rows is 50 and the trans->3rd rows stay 70 (they cap at 70);
//   2. the automatic path cannot take a rebirth, and the player's path reuses the same machinery;
//   3. the panel only offers the control the server says is ready.
