// Guards for the party_send_xy_timer SIGSEGV (exit 139) that killed the map server
// when the player teleported to Prontera.
//
// The crash frame was explicit:
//   RAGNAROK_CRASH_FRAME index=0x0 function=_Z19party_send_xy_timerilil+0x8c
// and the log showed the death-release lines immediately before it.
//
// Mechanism: pop_companion_register_local_party() moved a shell into a new party
// without leaving the old one. The roster is shared across the owner's characters,
// so switching characters (Jews -> radiator) re-runs the recall and moves every
// companion into the newly logged-in character's party - and the shell then had a
// data[].sd pointer in BOTH. shell_release() scrubs only party_search(
// status.party_id), i.e. the new party; party_send_xy_timer iterates EVERY party in
// party_db and dereferences data[i].sd after only a null check, so the stale
// pointer in the abandoned party was dereferenced after the shell was freed.
