// Guard the companion party-membership invariant.
//
// The bug this exists for: companions were registered through the char server,
// which persists membership as "UPDATE char SET party_id=N WHERE account_id=? AND
// char_id=?" - and population shells have no row in the char table, so the UPDATE
// matched nothing. The shell was left with status.party_id = 0, which made
// pop_is_companion() false. Everything downstream then saw no companions at all:
// the stance buttons reported "0 shells", summoned companions stood inert, and the
// self-heal sweep (which filtered on that same predicate) could never see the thing
// it existed to repair. One wrong membership path, four unrelated-looking symptoms.
//
// These are structural checks on the engine source: they assert the membership
// path is the map-local one, and that nothing filters on pop_is_companion() when
// repairing the very field that predicate requires.
