// Guards for the companion skill picker (phase 3: the in-game tick-box UI).
//
// The feature's risk is wiring, not logic, and two of these assertions exist because
// the wiring was actually wrong while everything compiled:
//
//   * the overlay was built by _skillPickerOverlay() and never appended anywhere, so
//     pressing Choose skills looked like a dead button. The panel is a single
//     component with no build step, so nothing but a test like this can catch it.
//   * the toggle started from an EMPTY selection when the companion had never been
//     configured, so the first untick kept only the clicked skill and the row of
//     ticks appeared to invert. The rule is now: a NULL skill_preset means the
//     companion is casting the whole class list, so a flip seeds from that list.
//
// The UI also may not send a list: the atcommand's `param` is 23 bytes, so the client
// must use the per-skill verbs. That is asserted here because a "send the whole list"
// client would look correct, work for a 1st-job companion, and silently truncate for a
// 4th-job one.
//
// Calibration: every test below must fail on the commit before phase 3.
