// Guards for the companion skill presets (population_skill_db.yml).
//
// Phase 2 filled the curated presets from ground truth: 1057 rows added across 57
// classes, taking the 4th jobs from 4-5 rows each to 13-73. Those classes were the
// worst case, because the Summon tab makes a 4th-job companion the easiest to
// draft while the engine gave it almost nothing to cast - Cardinal ran 5 skills out
// of the 81 its class tree grants.
//
// What must stay true now that the rows are generated rather than hand-written:
//
//   * NO (SkillId, Target) duplicate inside one block. The engine dispatches the
//     attack rotation and the ally/self buff list separately, so the SAME skill is
//     legitimately listed twice with different Targets (AL_HEAL self + ally is the
//     hand-written idiom). But the same skill at the same Target twice means the
//     rotation can pick a slot whose sibling is shadowed - a generator bug.
//   * Every Condition must exist in the engine's name map
//     (config/population_skill_db.cpp). An unknown one is not an error: the parser
//     logs a warning and leaves the condition at `always`, so a typo silently turns
//     a gated skill into an unconditional one.
//   * Every row needs SkillId and Level, and Target must be one of the three the
//     parser understands (current/self/ally).
//   * A 4th-job block must not fall back to a token rotation. This is the assertion
//     that fails on the pre-phase-2 commit and is the point of the change.
//
// Parsing note: no YAML dependency is available to the node tests, and the rows use
// two shapes (inline `{ ... }` maps and multi-line block maps). The small parser
// below handles both; it is deliberately tolerant of formatting so reformatting the
// file cannot fail these tests, only changing the DATA can.
