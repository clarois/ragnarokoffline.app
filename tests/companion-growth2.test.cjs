// Guards for the second round of companion growth work:

//   * the ownership-based recovery that stops a companion being silently
//     expelled when the char server replays the party without it
//   * the local party-window level broadcast (the stock path is a char-server
//     round trip that drops shells, so levels only ever updated on a map change)
