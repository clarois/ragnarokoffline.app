// Guards for three bugs found from the live server log after the party-membership
// fix went in. Each was reproduced from log evidence first, and each assertion
// below fails against the commit that shipped it.
//
// 1. "@companion summon <name>" called the batch recall, so summoning one companion
//    re-placed and re-broadcast EVERY companion - which visibly undid a bench the
//    player had just made ("pressing summon removed every companion").
//    Log evidence: only index 352's active flag changed, then "recalled 8".
//
// 2. Companions stood still. The placement-recovery branch reset its throttle
//    before knowing the placement succeeded, so a failing shell re-warped every
//    tick. Log evidence: "recovered off-map companion Hanazia" thirteen times in a
//    row; a shell teleported that often cannot walk.
//
// 3. The party window stayed empty at boot and filled only on a later pass. The
//    post-recall resync asked the char server (party_request_info) for a party
//    whose companion rows it does not have, so nothing came back.
