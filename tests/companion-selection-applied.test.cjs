// Guards for "a restored skill selection must actually be APPLIED".
//
// The bug this pins, found by reading `@companion dump` rather than by inference:
//
//     @SHELL|307|Avaten|15|2000001|1|13|9|1|1|1|7|1
//                                        ^override=1  ^attack_n=13 ^buff_n=9
//
// Every identity field was correct - the shell was Avaten, it was a companion, it was on the
// grid, and it HAD received skill_override_active. Only the lists were wrong: 13 attack and 9
// buff entries while the selection was empty, when the filter should have rejected every
// curated entry and left both at 0.
//
// Cause: recall_one_companion restores the selection but never asks for a rebuild. The lists
// are seeded earlier in that same call, while `override_active` is still false, so they hold
// the full class list; the per-tick seeder only rebuilds when a list is EMPTY or when
// `skills_need_reseed` is set, and it was neither. A restored selection was therefore stored,
// displayed in the panel, and never applied - on every login, for every companion.
//
// That single omission is why three earlier fixes (per-tick re-seed, buff-guard, sphere-chain
// gate) all appeared ineffective: each one filters lists that had already been filled before
// the override existed.
//
// These assertions pin the RELATIONSHIPS that make it work, because a compile test cannot see
// this class at all - removing the reseed line still compiles cleanly (verified).
