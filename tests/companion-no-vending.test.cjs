// windows-latest checks text files out with CRLF; normalise on read so assertions about file
// content do not depend on the checkout's newline convention.
// Guards for item 9: a recruited or drafted companion must not stand in vending mode.
//
// The mechanism this pins, all of it read out of the code rather than inferred from the symptom:
//
//   * population_engine_spawn_shell() decides vending from the PROFILE. A merchant-line shell
//     resolves a vendor config (or the built-in default stock) and runs
//     `sd->state.prevend = 1; vending_openvending(...)`.
//   * vending_openvending consumes `prevend` and sets `state.vending = true`. That live flag is
//     what the engine's own shell drivers test, which is why a vending companion stops following.
//   * Nothing in that path asks whether the shell is a companion.
//   * The fix is NOT in that block, and cannot be: both companion paths call spawn_shell() and
//     assign companion_owner_account only AFTERWARDS (draft: spawn -> owner; recall: spawn ->
//     owner), so a companion test inside spawn would never fire.
//
// So the stall is closed where companion status IS known: the local-party funnel that every
// draft/recall/re-sync/repair passes through, and the recruit hook that adopts an ambient vendor.
//
// NOTE ON ANCHORS: three of these functions have forward declarations whose text is a PREFIX of
// the definition, so `indexOf(name)` finds the declaration and every assertion then reads the wrong
// region - silently, usually as a passing test. Every lookup below therefore anchors on the
// definition's own signature INCLUDING its opening brace, which the declaration does not have.
