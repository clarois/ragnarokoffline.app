// windows-latest checks text files out with CRLF; normalise on read so assertions about file

// Guards for: a companion that changes job keeps using its OLD class's skills.
//
// Live evidence (map log + DB): 11 companions advanced from Acolyte
// ("advanced from Acolyte to Monk"/"...to Priest", DB job_id 15/8) and every one of
// them still cast Acolyte skills.
//
// Mechanism: the skill rotation and the self-buff list are seeded from
// sd->status.class_ but only built while their vectors are EMPTY:
//
//     if (sd->pop.attack_skills.empty()) { ...find(sd->status.class_)... }
//     if (sd->pop.buff_skills.empty())   { ...find(sd->status.class_)... }
//
// They are built once on the shell's first combat tick and never rebuilt, so a job
// change left the previous class's presets in place for the rest of the shell's
// life. The job-change path claimed to "re-arm the skill preset" but only ran
// sd->pop.skill_next_use_tick.clear(), which empties neither vector - so the
// empty() guard could never pass again.
