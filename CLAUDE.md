# Working in this repository

Read [README.md](README.md) first — its **Architecture** section is the real
reference and this file does not replace it. What follows is the part that is
easy to get wrong from inside the tree.

## The one that will bite you: there are two RemoteClients, and we use the Rust one

The asset server is
[**roBrowserLegacy-RemoteClient-Rust**](https://github.com/Flux159/roBrowserLegacy-RemoteClient-Rust)
— ours, a Rust rewrite. It ships as the `robrowser-remoteclient` binary and
serves `:3338`.

`vendor/roBrowserLegacy-RemoteClient-JS/` is the **upstream Node reference we
ported from**. It is kept for comparison. It does not run, and reading it to
answer "what does the server do?" gives answers that are plausible, detailed
and wrong — the two have diverged. Its `path-mapping.json`, for instance, is a
generated file with zero entries, and the Rust port implements no path mapping
at all.

If the checkout is not beside this one, ask rather than reading the JS copy.

**What the Rust server does, in order** (`src/client.rs`, `resolve`):

1. in-memory cache
2. loose files under the server root — `state/assets/`, which is where the
   translation layer and every mod's `data/` land
3. `DATA_OVERRIDE_PATH`
4. the GRFs, under the requested spelling, then under the Korean reading of it

A miss returns 404 and is appended to `state/assets/logs/missing-files.log`.
It never falls back to a different file, so it cannot serve *wrong* content —
only the right file or nothing. When a client renders the wrong sprite, the
asset server is not the suspect; when it renders nothing, that log names the
file.

## The three projects, and where each one's problems show up

| Piece | Ours? | Where it runs | Symptoms it owns |
|---|---|---|---|
| [nebula](https://github.com/Flux159/nebula) | ours | host | the microVM will not boot; guest images; `NEBULA_MIN_VERSION` |
| [rAthena](https://github.com/rathena/rathena) | upstream, built from our fork [Flux159/rathena](https://github.com/Flux159/rathena), vendored at `vendor/rathena` | in containers, in the VM | anything about rules: drops, refine, quests, NPCs, what a feature flag switches on |
| [roBrowserLegacy](https://github.com/MrAntares/roBrowserLegacy) | upstream, built from our fork [Flux159/roBrowserLegacy](https://github.com/Flux159/roBrowserLegacy), plus `patches/` | Chromium, in Electron | anything you can see: UI windows, sprites, packet parsing |
| RemoteClient (Rust) | ours | host, `:3338` | file resolution, GRF decoding, the WS→TCP proxy |

Everything Linux-side runs in containers inside a microVM the app carries. The
server is never ported; we bring the platform it is tested on.

### A fix to rAthena or roBrowserLegacy is a commit on the fork, not a patch

[docs/FORKS.md](docs/FORKS.md) is the reference. The short version:

- A bug in either project is fixed by a commit on the **`ragnarokoffline`**
  branch of our fork, then `scripts/vendor-bump.sh <name>` moves
  `config/VENDOR_PINS` to it. Do **not** add it to `patch-client.sh` or
  `apply-server-mods.sh`; those carry only what is ours (the population engine,
  the stylist, extension hooks, app wording).
- `ragnarokoffline` refuses force-pushes. Releases pin commits on it, so it only
  moves forward, and newer upstream is **merged** in, never rebased.
- Newer upstream comes in weekly, as pull requests that stop short of merging:
  [docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md](docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md).
- Work in a fork checkout beside this one (`~/Projects/rathena`,
  `~/Projects/roBrowserLegacy`). `vendor/` is a pinned copy the build patches in
  place, and anything done there is lost.
- roBrowserLegacy checks files out with CRLF. A whole-file diff means something
  rewrote the line endings.

### The seam where bugs actually live

rAthena and roBrowserLegacy are developed by different people against different
assumptions, and **the app is the only thing that makes them agree**. Both are
compiled/configured to the same packet version. The list is
`config/PACKETVERS` — the first line (**20221005**) is the default and the image
tag, and each other line is another full rAthena build in the same image under
a `-<packetver>` suffix (`images.yml` compiles each on its own runner). Settings → General → Client version picks one; the
supervisor (`stack/src/packetver.rs`) starts that build and rewrites the
client's `packetver`, so the two cannot drift. Only "main" client dates work:
rAthena builds 2015-11-05..2018-07-03 and 2020-09-02..2021-11-18 as RagexeRE,
which roBrowser has no packet tables for.

That still leaves a gap: rAthena will happily use a feature the client has never
implemented. `conf/battle/feature.conf` ships with `feature.refineui: on` and
`feature.stylist: on`; roBrowser implements the refine UI but gates it behind a
config flag, and does not implement the stylist window at all. The result is an
NPC that closes its dialogue and opens nothing.

**So when a UI "does not open", check three things in this order:**

1. Does roBrowser register and hook the packet? Search `Online.js` for the
   packet name, not the hex id — and use *its* names (`OPEN_REFINING_UI`, not
   `ZC_REFINE_OPEN_WINDOW`; `UI_OPEN`, not `ZC_OPEN_UI`).
2. Is it behind a `Configs.get("enable…")` flag? Several are, and
   `Config.js` does not define them all.
3. Does rAthena's script have a non-UI fallback? `getbattleflag("feature.x")`
   in an NPC script usually means it does.

`onUIOpen` handles exactly three `ui_type` values (7 attendance, 8 enchant
grade, 10 enchant). rAthena's enum is in `src/map/clif.hpp` — `OUT_UI_STYLIST`
is 1, and nothing handles it.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `stack/` | `ragnarok-stack`, the Rust supervisor. **No dependencies** — see below |
| `electron/` | the shell: `main.js` (privileged), `preload.js`, IPC |
| `config/Config.local.js` | the roBrowser config **template**; `write_client_config` in `stack/src/assets.rs` rewrites it per era and per mod |
| `config/VENDOR_PINS` | the exact commit of each upstream source; `vendor-fetch.sh` reads it, `vendor-bump.sh` moves it |
| `patches/`, `scripts/patch-client.sh` | roBrowserLegacy additions that are ours; its fixes are on the fork |
| `mods/` | bundled mods, shipped in the app |
| `examples/mods/` | worked examples, not shipped enabled |
| `vendor/rathena` | read it to answer "what does the server do?" |
| `third-party/population-engine` | our modified copy, GPL-3.0, changes marked `RAGNAROKMAC` |

`stack/` and the randomizer have **no crate dependencies**, on purpose: this
ships in a signed bundle, CI has to stay quick, and there is no dependency tree
to audit. Hand-rolled JSON, YAML-shape reading and zlib live there for that
reason. Match it — do not add a crate without saying why.

## Runtime state

`~/Library/Application Support/Ragnarok Offline/` on macOS.

| Path | Notes |
|---|---|
| `state/assets/` | the served root. **Rebuilt from scratch on every `link-assets`** |
| `state/mods/` | installed mods. Deliberately *outside* the asset root so a rebuild cannot destroy them |
| `state/assets/overlay.id` | fingerprint of the mod overlay; the shell clears the client's cache when it changes |
| `state/logs/`, `state/crashes/` | supervisor logs; preserved map-server crashes |
| `File System/` | Chromium's sandboxed FS — **roBrowser's own file cache** |

That last one is worth knowing about: roBrowser saves what it downloads and
looks there before asking the server again, keyed by filename. It survives
restarts, so a mod that replaces a stock file can appear to do nothing while
every status says it worked.

### Looking at the database

`ragnarok-stack sql "<query>"` reads it; `ragnarok-stack sql --write "<stmt>"`
changes it. Reads run against a live server. Writes must not: rAthena keeps
characters, homunculi, pets and inventories in memory and writes them back on
save, so an edit made underneath a running map server is overwritten within the
minute with nothing said. `--write` takes a backup and stops the game for you,
which is the whole reason to use it rather than `docker exec`.

The schema is `vendor/rathena/sql-files/main.sql`, and it is the code in
`vendor/rathena/src/map/` that decides what a column means -- `homunculus.alive`
is in the table and the char server neither reads nor writes it.
[docs/DATABASE.md](docs/DATABASE.md) is the reference, with worked repairs.

## Testing

- `cd stack && cargo test` — the supervisor's suite.
- `node --check electron/main.js` after touching the shell.
- `npm start` runs the app from source against the *same* state directory as
  the packaged build, which is still the quickest way to test a shell change —
  **but quit the packaged app first, and let it finish quitting.** The app
  takes a single-instance lock, keyed on Electron's `userData`, and both builds
  resolve that to `Application Support/Ragnarok Offline`. Neither way it fails
  prints anything, so learn to recognise them:
  - packaged app *running*: `npm start` exits 0 on the spot and the packaged
    window comes to the front. Nothing is wrong with your build.
  - packaged app *still quitting*: the teardown holds the lock for the whole
    of `stack down`, and a launch arriving during it is read as "bring the app
    back" — it queues a relaunch, so the **packaged** build reappears and your
    dev run is gone. Wait for it to leave the Dock.
- One copy at a time, and not only because of the lock: the ports are fixed
  (3338 for assets, 6900/6121/5121 for rAthena), so giving a second copy its
  own state with `RAGNAROK_OFFLINE_HOME` still collides — and two supervisors
  over one data disk is how the MariaDB volume loses its redo log.
  `--user-data-dir` gets past the lock but not the ports, so it is only worth
  anything for shell work that never presses play.
- Killing things: `pgrep -x` and kill by PID. `pkill -f <pattern>` has matched
  the agent's own shell in this repo and killed the session.

Check the vendor checkouts are on their pins before you trust a local result:
`scripts/vendor-fetch.sh <name> vendor/<name>` puts one back, and prints
`already at <sha>` when it was fine. Nothing warns you otherwise, and a drifted
`vendor/roBrowserLegacy` means `patch-client.sh` is patching a tree the release
never builds — the CI job clones the `config/VENDOR_PINS` commit fresh every
time, so a patch anchor that matches locally can still fail there. When a pin
has *moved*, `vendor-fetch.sh` (and so `bootstrap.sh`) discards everything in
that checkout except `node_modules` before moving it, and says so -- including
anything edited there by hand, which is why fix work happens in a fork checkout.

**CI runs on every pull request** and every push to `main`: `test.yml`. It
covers less than it sounds like, so know what it leaves out:

- `server-language` — the rAthena diagnostics in `tests/diagnostics/`: each
  must still find its bug in `rathena-upstream`, and must pass on our fork
  before and after `apply-server-mods.sh`.
- `client-build` — the patch set applied twice to the pinned roBrowser, a
  client build, `tests/client-extensions.test.cjs` and the mod-index check.
- `supervisor-and-lifecycle`, on Linux, macOS and Windows — `cargo test` and
  a build of `stack/`, `node --check electron/main.js`, the pinned
  RemoteClient and docker-slim builds, and the shell suite
  (`node --test tests/*.test.cjs`) against those binaries.

Not in CI: the Playwright end-to-end tests (`npm run test:e2e`), the Windows
install acceptance script, and the docs-site build. Nothing in CI starts the app
or a VM either, so an engine or Windows-only change still needs a real machine.
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the local build steps for each platform
and which test to run for which change.

`build.yml`, which builds and publishes the installers, runs only on `v*` tags
and manual dispatch. A tag push starts a public release by itself, so tag only
a commit that is already on `origin/main`.
