# Server warps for navigation

The navigation window routes between maps over the links in your own client:
kRO's warp portals, plus the NPCs that move you (sailors, signposts, airship
steps). This server places its portals from rAthena's scripts, so in
pre-renewal towns, which differ from kRO's renewal ones, and on maps a mod adds,
those routes lead to the wrong place or nowhere.

With this mod on, routes use the server's portals instead: the `warp` and
`warp2` lines in the scripts the server loads for your era, the stock scripts
other mods switch on (`stock-npc.txt`), and the scripts other mods ship. A
portal switched off when the server starts (`disablenpc "<name>"` under
`OnInit`) is left out, so a mod that reroutes a gate is routed over correctly.
One that some script switches back on with `enablenpc` is kept: it is a gate an
event or a quest opens, and open some of the time. A portal that starts hidden
or disabled (`warp(DISABLED)`, `warp2(HIDDEN)`) or is a `duplicate(...)` of
another isn't routed over; in the stock scripts, those are all on instance
maps, which are left out anyway.

Your client's other links stay: a sailor or a signpost is a script that warps
you when spoken to, which cannot be read the way a portal can. Its precomputed
route distances, which describe its own portals, are set aside, so routes take
the fewest maps.

`warp-index.tsv` lists the pinned rAthena's portals, which live in the server
image rather than on your machine. It is generated from the pin with the app's
server mods applied. `scripts/vendor-bump.sh` regenerates it when the rAthena
pin moves; after changing the server mods' scripts, run (CI fails until it
matches):

```
scripts/navigation-index.sh
```
